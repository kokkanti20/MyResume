# MyResume

**Input**

The "MyResume" web application accepts fixed input data, encompassing the user's personal information, educational history, abilities, professional experience, and project specifics. This information is embedded in the Resume.js file as a React component. The application employs a designated CSS file, Resume.js, to format the page in accordance with the set criteria, including colors, margins, and typefaces.

**Process**

The application is developed with React. Upon application initiation, the App.js code renders the Resume component. The Resume.js component organizes the input data into distinct parts such as Education, Skills, Experience, and Projects. The Resume.css file implements styling to align the layout, colors, and fonts with the specified design. The virtual DOM of React updates and renders the user interface efficiently, while the development server facilitates real-time browser previews.

**Output**

The application presents a meticulously organized and aesthetically designed résumé webpage. Users can view their information categorized into parts using a backdrop color of rgba(#bdfb04) , black text, and adaptive margins. The page conforms to the specified requirements, presenting a professional appearance.
